      <p>Geo Vale is a VR game which explores the idea of escapism and helps the player fully immerse themselves in a peaceful farm life.</p>
      <p>Escape to a peaceful, idyllic world with Geo Vale, a virtual reality game that immerses players in the joys of farm life. As the only 
        farmer in this peaceful village, you will plant crops and sell them to the population, while also engaging in a variety of activities. 
        You’ll have the freedom to customize your environment using the Level Editor, located inside your house. This Level Editor allows you 
        to select and place objects, move and rotate existing objects, summon new NPCs, and create custom NPC paths. With its tranquil atmosphere 
        and immersive gameplay, Geo Vale is the perfect escape from the stresses of real life.</p><br>
        <p><b>Features:</b></p>
        <p> •	<b>Day/Night Cycle –</b> Time in Geo Vale is limited, as it is in the real world. All farm work must be done during the day, to allow the<br> 
              plants to have time to grow to their next growth stage overnight.<br><br>
            •	<b>Shopkeeper NPC schedules –</b> Each shop keeper has an assigned stall which they will arrive to at 7am most morning. All shopkeepers have<br> 
                an assigned day off, so make sure to learn their schedules. Once 5pm hits, all shopkeepers will close their shops and head home.<br><br>
            •	<b>NPC schedules –</b> Each civilian will wake up at a randomly assigned time and spend their day walking around the village, entering shops<br> 
                and interacting with each other. No civilian likes hanging around at night, so once the world begins to go dark, all civilians will<br> 
                start making their way home.<br><br>
            •	<b>NPC Movement –</b> There are two distinct NPC behaviours. One is path following, an NPC will follow a previously created path. Once they <br>
                reach the end of the path, they select a different path and find the closest point on the path to start at. The other behaviour is wandering, <br>
                the NPC will walk around the area with no end goal.<br><br>
            •	<b>Sleeping mechanic –</b> Farming is a tiring but rewarding job. Once night time come, you begin to feel tired, and must head to bed to<br> 
                replenish your energy. Otherwise, you will pass out and a kind civilian will take you to your house, where you will wake up in the morning.<br><br>
            •	<b>Vehicles –</b> The village is a small but beautiful area which attracts a lot of visitors. Cars often drive through the town, obeying the traffic<br> 
                light system, and often will take use of the offered parking to explore the village.<br><br>
            •	<b>Inventory System –</b> Life is difficult for a farmer without a backpack. So take use of your 3 available pocket spaces to minimise the amount of<br> 
                trips you need to take.<br><br>
            •	<b>Level Editor Object Placing –</b> With the Level Editor, you can choose out of the list of given objects and place them around the world. The world<br> 
                is your oyster, if you are a fan of a more green world, select one of the 3 available types of trees and decorate your area to your desires.<br>
                If you desire to have neighbours on your farmland, select an NPC house and place it wherever you please.<br><br>
            •	<b>Level Editor Object Rearranging –</b> If you believe the placement of an object in the world is off, select it on the Level Editor and move and <br>
                rotate it until it fits your ideal.<br><br>
            •	<b>Level Editor NPC Spawning –</b> If you desire a more populated town, summon more civilians to walk around and add life to the environment. You can<br>
                assign them one of the default paths available.<br><br>
            •	<b>Level Editor Custom NPC Path –</b> You can create your own path for your new NPC friend. Simply create a custom path and save it for future use. Watch <br>
             as the civilians take notice of your new path and decide to head on a journey to explore the new path.<br><br>
            •	<b>Create Planting Fields –</b> With your trusty hoe, you can turn any patch of land on your farm into a field. This field is now ready for planting.<br><br>
            •	<b>Plant Types – </b>You will start off with one of each seed types. Each seeds grows it’s own, different produce. Take note of which seeds seem to be cheaper<br>
                to grow.<br><br>
            •	<b>Plant Watering –</b> All plants need water to thrive. Make sure to water your plants daily as they progress through the growth stages. A missed day of watering,<br> 
                is an extra day you have to wait for your plants to grow.<br><br>
            •	<b>Harvesting –</b> Once your plant is fully grown and the produce are ready to be harvested, pick them and take them to the seeds shopkeeper. Drop them into the <br>
                available box and wait for the shopkeeper to transfer your funds during the night.<br><br>
            •	<b>Buying More Seeds –</b> The life of a farmer is cyclic. From buying seeds, to planting, to harvesting, to buying again. Take note of which plants seem to sell for <br>
                the most and earn profit by buying only the best quality seeds.<br><br>
            •	<b>Tree Chopping –</b> While pretty, trees also take of important farming space. With your trust axe, you can get rid of any tree in your way. You can also sell the <br>
                logs for profit.<br><br>
            •	<b>Grass Collecting –</b> Plant fibres may be of no use to you, but someone out there thrives off of the grass you sell. Instead of destroying the grass on your farm<br>
                 by placing farming fields, consider taking some time to collect them and sell them for an extra bit of money.<br><br>
            •	<b>Animals –</b> Once you are well settled on your farm, invest in some animals. Milk, eggs and truffles can sell for a pretty penny with minimal extra work needed. <br>
                Make sure to collect the items daily so as to not miss out. Each animal will produce one item daily, if an item is not picked up, the item will remain there the next day.<br><br>

      <h3><b>The Game World</b></h3>
      <h5>The game is set in a flat, green world. </h5>
    </div>

    <div class="w3-container">
      <p>The world is split into two main parts, the player’s farm and the NPC town where the player can do their shopping. . The game world is surrounded by <br>
        tall trees and mountains which the player cannot access, but are there to limit the player’s movement to stay within the bounds of the village.</p><br>
      <p>
        <b>Player Farm</b><br>
        <p>Takes up approximately one third of the map. This is the only area in which the player can create their planting fields. This area contains the player<br>
            house, a coop, a barn, multiple trees and grass and a table containing all of the necessary tools.</p><br>
        <b>NPC Estate</b><br>
        <p>This area contains all the houses belonging to the NPCs. Each NPC has an assigned house. Some of the houses have a car out front. The houses are lined <br>
          up neatly along a road. The estate is decorated with grass, trees and functional streetlamps.</p><br>
        <b>Town</b><br>
        <p>This area contains all the stalls and NPC shops. There is a small parking for the visiting NPCs. In the centre, there is a town plaza with a tree in the <br>
          centre. Around the plaza, there are three stalls that the player can access to buy seeds and animals. There are also shop buildings which are only accessible <br> 
          to the NPCs. The town is decorated with streetlamps, plants, trees, grass, benches and bins. </p><br>
        <b>Player House</b><br>
        <p>This is a very small area. It is accessed by the player by entering the teleporter in front of the player house. Inside, there is a bed, for the player to use,<br>
            and the map editor. This area can be exited by entering a transporter by the door which takes the player back to the farm. </p><br>
        <b>Travel</b><br>
        <p>There are two forms of travel. The first is by using the joystick to walk slowly around the area. The other being the teleporter that the player can <br>
            use with the select button to quickly get from one area to another.</p><br>
        <b>Scale</b><br>
        <p>Everything in the world is within walking distance. The scale of the world and the objects were set to mimic the size of them in the real world.</p><br>
        <b>Objects</b><br>
        <p>Gardening utensils are given to the player at the start of the game. These utensils include a hoe, axe and watering can. They are the three main tools <br>
            of the game, and the game cannot be played without them. The hoe is used for creating planting field, the axe is used to get rid of trees that are in <br>
            the player’s way, and the watering can is used to water the plants to let them progress to the next growth stage.</p><br>
        <b>Weather</b><br>
        <p>The game weather is always sunny, and the game world is always bright during the daytime. Night-time weather is clear but dark.
        </p><br>
        <b>Day and Night</b><br>
        <p>The majority of the game takes place during the day cycle, once night-time comes, the player has to finish up their work in order to make it to bed by <br>
          midnight. The sun can be seen moving across the screen, at 6pm the sun sets and the world turns darker, starting the night cycle.</p><br>
        <b>Time</b><br>
        <p>The game starts off at 4am, 10 seconds of in-game town is equal to 1 second in real time.</p><br>
